Please Note:
=======================

* **These examples are not yet complete** - they will be completed within the next few weeks, at which point this message will be removed.

* The current solution is for Visual Studio 2012 *only*.  Once the examples are complete, we will create a Visual Studio 2010 solution as well.

* The package assemblies are not commited to source control so **you must enable NuGet Package Restore** to build this solution.
  To do so, go to `Tools > Options > Package Manager` and enable the `Allow NuGet to download missing packages` option.
